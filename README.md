# A Genetic Algorithm for the 2D Bin Packing Problem

For every set of bin packing data there exists a unique ordering which 
produces the optimal solution when run through the first fit algorithm.
The problem lies in finding this ordering, especially on large data sets.
To try and solve this, this project is a genetic algorithm solution that
attempts to find as close an optimal ordering as possible.

## How to Run

Download the source files, compile the file Driver.java (javac Driver.java), then run
the Driver file (java Driver). It will then ask you for numerous directions to run the
program. Have fun!
